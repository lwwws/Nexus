[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): This month (Machine Learning I)  We will talk about the basics of machine learning. An overview of machine learning "metadata" (The stuff you should know about ML)  Other things we'll talk about:  Supervised Learning: Regression with Linear Regression Supervised Learning: Classification with Decision Trees  support vector machines  and K-Nearest Neighbors Unsupervised Learning: Clustering with KMeans
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We will be making use of python and datasets from Kaggle to demonstrate.
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Everything we've learned so far (AI general knowledge  python programming  maths for ML  basics of statistics) will count as Machine Learning is a combination of all these things.
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Honour (E.H.H): Please am new here and I don't understand anything
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Don't worry fam  we've got you covered  I'll be sharing resources that cover to a great deal what we've talked about so far.

[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): For everyone  Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. (7mins watch)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01tIRP_Rqs
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): @2349059844630   as said earlier  I'm not a fan of using videos to learn a programming language so I'll just refer you to programiz  hackerrank  and the python documentation
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): at python.org
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But if you're the video type  you can heck out "Tech with Tim"  or "Programming with Mosh"  they both have great videos
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Freecodecamp's python tutorial is nice too
[00:00, 02/01/2024] Honour (E.H.H): Okay thanks I will check these out tomorrow I prefer videos

[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): My manchees
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): How una dey
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It's safe to assume that we've all done this
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So I'd like to drop a few polls 🌚
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: Scorpion we greet
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Egbon. Your shoe shine boss. 🙌🏾
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So I'm going to be posting a few Machine Learning problems and you'll vote on what type of machine learning task it is. whether it's supervise learning  unsupervised learning  or (bonus reinforcement learning)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Let's start with something easy
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: An app that predicts the future price of Ethereum OPTION: Supervised Learning (14 votes) OPTION: Unsupervised Learning (0 votes) OPTION: Reinforcement Learning (0 votes) 
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Ok  looks like that one was a breeze
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: Machine Learning model to match guys in BUCC with girls in Nursing for valentines day #thisSeasonIsOurSeason OPTION: Supervised Learning (5 votes) OPTION: Unsupervised Learning (7 votes) OPTION: Reinforcement Learning (0 votes) 
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Una no wan vote? 😂
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Can anyone explain why it's unsupervised learning?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Also @2349044195816 and @2348148935061 can you explain why it's supervised
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: It’s supervised because the data is going to be labeled and it’s feeling more like a regression problem than a classification problem.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: If I’m correct I go need cash price sha
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We gats pay for your time normally
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: Actually I just cross checked and I’m like 99.9999% sure it’s supervised
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): interesting 🤔
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you were to implement this kind of model  what approach will you take?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The answer depends greatly on how you choose to implement it actually
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: A decision tree is the one I can try to explain  You train a random forest or Ensemble for the entire data  then the concept would be that given a guy example using his preference from the table  you can filter out the ladies that match or are close. .
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Interesting. 🤔
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Edidiong: The data should be labelled I guess.. We’ll take features from both groups in order to make matches
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Edidiong: Just like how dating apps work
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Interesting
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So more like labelling different subgroups in the nursing and bucc distribution and joining people that fall into the same class
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Can anyone from team unsupervised talk about any ideas of how they could implement this unsupervised?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Edidiong: Well.. feature selection from like their inputs.. Characteristics like similar interests.. the model will learn to predict from those input data
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Kev: The most possible way would be to use a clustering algorithm But then it doesn’t end there because you have to be matched to someone (I guess)   so once people are clustered based on the many variables. Then  a recommendation system can be used
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Another interesting approach
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I see
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Alright.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So it's a model that matches people to other people right?  and it's supposed to match BUCC boys to Nursing girls (and vice versa)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So now what are the constraints we have to look out for? Why do we need machine learning? Why not just match a random BUCC boy to a random Nursing girl?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That's going to be a big problem. We want people to use our model (or use the dating app that's powered by our model)   We want people to be matched with others that have similar interests with them
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): E.g  we don't want to match an introverted workaholic guy with an extroverted girl that likes to party
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We don't want a Portable and Billie Eilish match up either 😂
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): or a Mercy Chinwo and Rahman Jaggo match up
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We don't want to match a Muslim with someone who's favourite food is pork chop (you get the point)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: That’s a little racist 🤣 .
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So our constraint is that two people must have similar interest
[00:00, 10/01/2024] luxury.dev: Justice for portable
[00:00, 10/01/2024] M.I: I swear
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Na portable go first complain. No be Billie Eilish 😂😭
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now  in our data set  we have people with their different features we captured in a survey or through our app.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now we can't really label the data. Unless we want to define a fixed set of labels (say jovial  introverted  fun  career-minded  etc)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Then classify people into these fixed labels.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Even at that  we would still need to label our training dataset with these labels (which could be a lot of work considering that BUCC is over 2000 and like 75% of them are guys)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now we can find some way to turn these different data points (BUCC boys and Nursing girls) to numbers.  Have some kind of function (remember our linear transformation and calculus study jam 🌚) that maps these different samples into points  such that:  1. The numbers depend on the features of the students we're interested in. e.g interests  level  likes and dislikes  cgpa  hobbies  etc. 2. The distance between two points; A and B  in this function (our new universe) is a good reflection of the distance between A and B in the real world based on the features.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What I just described is something called Embedding.  Embedding is a Deep Learning Unsupervised technique. (You don't need to worry about how this works now until our Deep Learning month)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We can achieve Embedding in classical Machine Learning through something called Clustering
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We can also achieve it with something called "Dimensionality Reduction" We will discuss all these things this month and next.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): All we just need to do after training our Embedding would be to convert all our data into data points in this embedding function.  We can then calculate the distance between an embedding point A and all other embeddings and sort based on which is closest to my own embedding. A simple sorting algorithm will do (no need for ML at this part)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So think of it this way. Let's use me as an example.  I like basketball  and football. I like writing code. my top music genres include afro beats  alte  hip hop  and a bit of rock n roll. My favorite artists are Kanye  Drake  and AC/DC.  A girl who likes basketball but not football  with top music genres: afro beats  rap  and UK drill  with favorite artists Rema and Dave   Will have a closer distance to my point on the Embedding than a girl that  likes skiing and ice hockey  with top music genres: gospel  rock n roll  EDM  white noise  with favorite artists  Mercy Chinwo  the beatles  Elvis Presley  and Nathaniel Bassey.   Say my point on the embedding turns out to be 0.33452  The first girl will be something like 0.3399  and the third girl will be something like -3.2459
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Another approach will be to use a clustering algorithm like KMeans (Unsupervised learning).   What this will do is it will generate random labels for you  group similar students together based on the distance between the features themselves  and assign random labels to these different group.s
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So it's just going to return all the Nursing girls that fall into the same randomly generated label as you. (Tough luck if no one falls into your label 😭)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Any questions or insights before I drop the next poll?  (Hint it's going to be one that may cause you to think deeply and discuss your ideas on this gc)
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Alright
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Meshai: Sorry I don't understand the difference The first will show you a recommendation based on the distance between the embedding points which is like a combination of the person's features and the clustering algorithm will show you a recommendation of someone based on the distance between your features Maybe I don't understand very well but it doesn't seem there's that much of a difference
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Good question
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now the major difference between clustering and embedding is that   normal clustering works with the features and uses this comparison to group the samples.  Embedding is parsing these features of our samples through a mathematical function to represent them with a number or array of numbers. We can now compare these numbers with each other.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Another simple example of clustering.  You'd like to cluster people based on their finances using account balance as a feature. It's just going to compare the account balance of the samples with each other and group them.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): A slightly more complex example would be clustering the people but this time adding more features. Adding the number cars they have  the value of their stock portfolio  the value of their real estate  etc
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So it just groups them. you only need to specify how many groups you want.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Oba: Based on the embedding technique aspa it's use of functions and numbers does that mean it's more precise?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well  in this case  yes. An Embedding technique  if trained with lots of data will be more precise as all it's doing is its converting the data to a comparable array of numbers.   It's accuracy depends on how well it represents the real world data
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now Embedding on the other hand  is not doing any grouping. It's just mapping each sample to a vector or array of numbers
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Meshai: So sorry Maybe i don't get understand much but in this example their account balance  value of real estate and such Isn't it labeled data?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Ok  so it's not labeled. When we say a dataset is labeled  what we mean is that the samples are labeled (not the features).  E.g  This dataset will be labeled if each sample is given one of the tags: poor  middle-class  rich  elite
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We are the ones as humans that will have to find a way to label the data
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That's where it got the name "supervised" from.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We can have data with labeled samples but unlabeled features.  Like images and videos.  Say you'd like to classify images of animals. You have a dataset of the images mapped to a finite set of labels (dog  cat  fish  rabbit) but the images themselves are just a bunch of numbers.  It's still supervised learning
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Back to this  now that we have numbers  we can mathematically find the distance between two points in our embedding.  Think of it with this illustration. Imagine you have your house address  and you put it into Google Maps. Google Maps has to convert that address to points on the globe (latitude and longitude) before it can find the distance between wherever you are and that place.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It's not an example of Embedding  but embedding is used to solve these kinds of tasks
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The most common use case of embeddings is in NLP (Natural Language Processing).  we can embed words so we can respond to similar words in similar ways.  An embedding of the word "man" will be closer to the word "woman" than the word "mouse". Likewise the word "mister" will be closer to the word "man" than the word "woman". (Check out GloVe and Word2Vec. two popular text embedding models)  We've converted the words to numbers strictly to compare them to other words.
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): @2348059393725 Does that answer your question?
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Meshai: Yes it does Thank you
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Awesome
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now  the third and final question
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I'd give us 24 hours to discuss and vote
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: Is ChatGPT supervised learning  unsupervised learning  or reinforcement learning? or is it a combination of 2 or all? OPTION: It is supervised. (Explain) (10 votes) OPTION: It is unsupervised (Explain) (8 votes) OPTION: It is reinforcement learning (Explain) (10 votes) 
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If it's a combination  select more than one answers
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Be sure to discuss this here in this group chat. I'd like to observe the though process of every one of you
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Cheers  if you need me  I'd be listening to some Asake
[00:00, 10/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Check this guy out as well  https://zapier.com/blog/how-does-chatgpt-work/
[00:00, 11/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yo guys
[00:00, 11/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): How's it going
[00:00, 11/01/2024] Onofiok: Gooooood 🌚
[00:00, 12/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Whats up guys
[00:00, 12/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 15/01/2024] chibuzor: Isn't it past 24hrs already?
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh  well  i was chilling to see if there would be dialog or discussion about the question
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I'm seeing a lot of votes in here. Does anyone have anything to say about their choice?
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): @2349014307553 @2348084276257 @2349131869375 @2348118572658 ?
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): @2348059393725 👀🔥
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Edidiong: Supervised Learning The training data are labelled.. for it to have like an initial understanding of what things are/mean.. So when it’s needed  it knows the right output to give.. It’s just fed a lot of those data  And for the reinforcement learning part of it.. asper reward system now so they use this one for improving chatgpt’s output decisions  actions  behavior.. through users feedback (like  dislike  regenerate buttons them them) So when the alg receives a penalty.. o ti fuck up.. otherwise  a reward helps it know it made the right decision and keep in that pattern.. something like that  I’m not really sure about the unsupervised part of it.. there’s probably that aspect for interpreting users requests that the machine itself hasn’t come across.. idk
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Interesting take @2349044195816 🤔🔥
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Nailed it  especially on the reinforcement learning part.  ChatGPT uses reinforcement learning techniques to readjust itself when it receives feedback from the user that it's either doing something right or wrong.
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Edidiong: Right
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Have you come across the term "Human Guided Machine Learning" before .
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): There's another term for it that's more popular  just can't remember it rn.
[00:00, 15/01/2024] exotic olive oil taster: rlhf?
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yess. This. Reinforcement Learning from human feedback
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Edidiong: Nahh
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Edidiong: Oh
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It's basically what you described.  Instead of programming a reward system like in most reinforcement learning applications  you rely on human feedback.
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): Chatgpt is said to have been trained on like 500gb+ of data btw
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): This helps GPT improve the quality of its responses. its mostly used to make sure GPT doesn't give out offensive responses.
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That's very interesting.
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Edidiong: Yeahh I feel Majority of the deep learning powered systems use the raw programming rewards but this one is user centred Hmm
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yup. In contrast to RLHF or reinforcement learning in general  deep learning is based on linear algebra and optimization.  We're optimizing a loss function or cost function based on a set of functions in deep learning.  In reinforcement learning  we create something called an agent and provide it with an environment. We then give the agent a goal and a bunch of actions it can take. We provide a reward system for the agent to check if its previous actions brought it closer or further from the goal.  In RLHF  the reward system is based on a perception of how the human feels. Is the human happy with this action I just took?
[00:00, 15/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now does anyone have an idea of how ChatGPT comes up with their responses?  How does the model answer your pressing questions? or rather  how does it come up with the sentences or a unique sentence each time you ask?
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): I thought chatgpt's one was unsupervised then fine tuned
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well I would say chatgpt is a combination of all three.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Supervised  Unsupervised  and Reinforcement learning
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Unsupervised? Explain
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It's supervised from the perspective of it's ability to detect certain types of requests and deny them.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): For example  if you ask ChatGPT how to make crystal meth  it wouldn't give you an answer (don't ask me how I know this)
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Yes and also moderating what to learn from people's feedback input
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): yes
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): There's also an element of it that's unsupervised.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Some might say the major gismo
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): So basically fine tuning is a form of supervised learning
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Which is?
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well  fine-tuning itself  is more of a way to make the model better.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Basically Human Classification the good  the bad and the ugly
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Like saying  I've got this generalized model  and I'd like to fine-tune it for my specific use case.  Let's say you're developing a facial recognition system. You then fine-tune it to make it work for blurry images
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Hmmm 🤔 Isn't it just like making your own clusters?
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): so it's not really a machine learning algorithm per say.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Think of fine-tuning as refactoring your code to make it better
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Like saying  ok  i'm going to replace this array with a lookup table so my code can be faster.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Owh like giving it extra data to learn etc
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): yup
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): as for this
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Was about asking
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The answer is embedded in this
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The core technology behind ChatGPT is something called text generation.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Legacy chatbots before deep learning relied on "prompt-to-intent" mapping (I made that up) or rather Intent classification  This basically means I have a set of predefined questions or prompts with the intents.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): as my training data
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): so let's say I'm building a customer service chatbot.  I have questions like "Hi how are you" mapped to "greeting" and "I cant find the so called 'any' key on my keyboard" to "techSupport"
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I just train my model to predict (classify) different sentences to intents.  Then I program callbacks or handlers to handle these intents using traditional programming.  Say if I see greeting  I program the app to return "Hi  How can I help you today"  If i see an intent that suggests the prompt has some information I'd like to know about  I use pattern matching to extract that info.  For example "Set an alarm for 7pm Friday". The intent could be "setAlarm". I then use pattern matching algorithms to extract the time "7pm" and "Friday". (I worked on a pattern matching project about 2 years ago  I'll try to find the repo and share)
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The problem with this though  is that our chatbot can only handle a finite number of intents. (less robust  does not scale)  Another problem is that we need to program handlers or callbacks for each intent. We either do it ourselves or hire a software engineer to do it for us (costly).  The third problem is that we would need to put in considerable effort in making it's responses dynamic
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: So what your saying is that unsupervised learning causes this wide range of human text understanding
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Alright  so unsupervised learning in this concept comes to play in the sense that  we want to make our model as robust as possible. So we train it on lots of data (In GPT's case  the corpus of the entire internet)  That's too much data to label. We have an infinite number of intents   We need an unsupervised learning algorithm that can make this work
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That's where text generation comes in
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Unlike intent classification  text generation is a "next word" algorithm
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): To keep things simple  all it does  is that it takes note of the words that come after each word.  For example.  "I love chicken".  In this sample  The X -> Y mapping would be "I" to "love"  "I love" to "Chicken" and "I love chicken" to a token that represents the end of the sentence. say full stop.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Then what it tries to do is it tries to predict the next word that should come after a given set of words. That given set of words will serve as a form of context
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): for example.  If I have two strings in my training set  "Ade went to the farm"  "Ade was sick and went to the hospital"   And I have an input to my model that says  "Ade felt a bit ill  so he decided to go to the..."  The model will predict the next word to be "hospital"
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It does this prediction by calculating the probability of each word in it's dictionary to make sense in the sentence.  In this case  "hospital" has a higher probability of making sense than "farm".
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Now also note that for this to be effective  the embeddings that we talked about will also come into play.
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So it's possible for the model to predict the next word to be "clinic" instead of "hospital"/
[00:00, 16/01/2024] chibuzor: Good explanation  thanks
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We will try our hands on text generation before the summer holidays
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Please check the description of this gc🤗
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): I’ve missed a lot 🙆‍♀️
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 😅  The next couple of days will be a lot more fun
[00:00, 16/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yo guys
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What's up
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Caleb: <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] exotic olive oil taster: my oga
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Emmerick: <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Hellooo
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): How are you guys doing
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I'm going to be sharing some resources here
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHoEbRH46Zk
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): This is a 5 mins introduction numpy and pandas
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRsE5WGiKWo  This one is a 15 minutes crash course on NumPy
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Also  I'd like every one of us to have a software called Anaconda installed on our computers
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: ? OPTION: I know how to download and install Anaconda (10 votes) OPTION: I do not know how to download and install Anaconda (4 votes) OPTION: Well  I don't know unless I try (1 vote) 
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The main platform we will actually be using here is something called Google Colab.  But I acknowledge that our great university has a serious network problem and I don't want that to be a barrier as Google Colab runs on the cloud.   So I'd like us to have the tools we will be working with locally set up and installed on our machines. The easiest way to get that done is to use Anaconda.  It will install the basic data science libraries as well as something called Jupyter Notebook
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Is Pycharm allowed?
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Absolutely  I personally prefer it to VS Code👀
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You can use anything you're comfortable with really.   But something that has a notebook-like interface would be nicer.
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Or anaconda
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I think PyCharm and VS Code have extensions for notebooks
[00:00, 17/01/2024] exotic olive oil taster: blasphemy 😭
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): You kind of have to use both together  I mean I do
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Why? The do the same thing rii
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yh  sure. Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook.
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Not really  anaconda serves as the virtual environment
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Lowkey PyCharm is better. Only problem with it is you're stuck with that ugly jetbrain theme
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: So for this notebook part what do I download? .
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): How dare you😭😭
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Kinda looks fine for me .
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It dulls my vibe abeg 😂
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Anaconda is basically a suit
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): *suite
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): it comes with a lot of stuff to help you
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 😂  Maybe it's because I use it on Linux. VS code on linux is also quite dull
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Linux?! Agba dev 🙌
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Well maybe but It's actually relatively dull but still you didn't have to call it out like that😭😭
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Omo  na Ubuntu boss 😂. I plan to move to Arch sha
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: So there's no other option for notebook except Anaconda
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): .
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Sure.
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): You can use kaggle notebook too...  But Google colab is the best fr
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: It's local
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): When it comes to ease of use sha😅
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Nah  on your Web browser.  You looking for local options?
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Isn't anaconda's notebook local?
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): It is
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): I think Jupyter notebook is part of the anaconda package
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): And it's local
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: So what's the UI like in anaconda compared to Pycharm on like a scale of 1-10m
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Coz I can't use eclipse IDE o
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well  technically anaconda has no interface.  It just installs the tools and creates something called a "virtual environment" where it installs all the modules for you
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Shepherd: Use Vim
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Abeg don't punish me 😂 I can't die before my time
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That one sef dey
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Well for the sake of this whole thing I think I'll just download Anaconda
[00:00, 17/01/2024] chibuzor: Just did my research and if Jetbrains Dataspell wasn't premium would've definitely gone for it
[00:00, 17/01/2024] zee: Did you say cable? What's that?
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Kaggle
[00:00, 17/01/2024] zee: I think I'll just install anaconda even I have pycharm
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yup. to keep it simple
[00:00, 17/01/2024] zee: I don't know how the notebook works there
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Edidiong: Colab
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): from what @2349014307553 says  I think their notebooks comes in another product called Dataspell
[00:00, 17/01/2024] Edidiong: You won’t worry about locally installing libraries

[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So I'll be creating a group chat for everyone who selected the first and third options on this poll.  I cooked up a data engineering roadmap which we will be following.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): In other news  I believe by now everyone should've watched the 15 mins video on Numpy
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): before we proceed  I'd like to post a few questions here for you to vote
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: What is Numpy OPTION: It's a machine learning framework (0 votes) OPTION: It's a library for scientific computing (0 votes) OPTION: It's a library for manipulating numbers (0 votes) OPTION: It's a library for super fast operations on arrays and matrices (12 votes) 
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: What makes Numpy so fast? What's so special about Numpy OPTION: It was written in C++. Duhh (0 votes) OPTION: It's based on concurreny. It's multithreaded. that's definitly it (0 votes) OPTION: It's based on parallel processing. It distributes the tasks across multiple CPUs. (0 votes) OPTION: It uses something called "vectorization" which lets us run computations on arrays without loops. (13 votes) 
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: Why would a Data Scientist ever want to know NumPy? (Select all that apply) OPTION: Data Scientists work with numbers. Libraries like numpy make it a lot easier (9 votes) OPTION: Numpy allows us to perform linear transformations on arrays and vectors easily. (good for ML) (12 votes) OPTION: Numpy has machine learning models implemented for us so we don't need to write them ourselves (0 votes) OPTION: Numpy has a lot of mathematical helper functions that we can use. (11 votes) OPTION: We don't need Numpy in Data Science (0 votes) 
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): This coming Sunday  we would have a study jam on implementing Linear Regression with Numpy
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): In the meantime  you can read about linear regression here  https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/regression-analysis/find-a-linear-regression-equation/#:~:text=Remember%20from%20algebra%2C%20that%20the y'%20%3D%20b%20%2B%20ax.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Try to come up with a linear regression model *by hand* for this dataset  X = [01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10] Y = [02  04  06  08  11  12  14  15  19  20]
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Hint  the model in this case is an equation in the form of  Y = MX + c  Some textbooks will say it's  Y = aX + b
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): X is something called the independent variable.  Y is something called the dependent variable.   Y depends on X. (e.g how well you pass Dr Ernest course is dependent on how often you attend his classes)
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): a dependent variable depend on more than one independent variables.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): For example   How well you pass Dr Ernest course (Y) depends on how often you attend his classes (X1) and how well you study (X2)
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): in this case   Y = M1X1 + M2X2 + c
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): M represents something called a slope (or gradient).
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): it's kind of like saying  how much does X relate to Y.  How dependent is Y on X? that's the slope.  slopes can be positive and negative. A negative slope means  Y is negatively dependent on X.  E.g (Your fitness level is negatively dependent on how often you eat junk food)  The more you eat junk food  the lower your fitness level becomes.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So let's say you're building something to predict fitness levels.  You can say something like   Junk food intake reduces your fitness level and hours spent exercising increases your fitness level.  If X1 is junk food intake or calories from junk food  and X2 is hours spent exercising    Assuming M1 is -1 and M2 is 1 the equation will be something like  Fitness = -X1 + X2 + c
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): the variable c is something called a bias.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): think of the bias c as a number representing all the things our model didn't capture that affects Y
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): For example  In our fitness case  it's possible that some people aren't getting enough sleep. That can also affect your fitness level.  But that data wasn't captured in our model.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): In the Dr Ernest example  There are other factors such as:  1. Participation in the lab classes 2. Watching the recommended movies 3. Reading other resources apart from the ones he provided  All these will influence Y (how well you pass)  but our model only captures attendance and study hours.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So do we all understand the general idea behind Linear regression?
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Also  we will be resuming our anonymous this Sartuday.  We will also be changing the tool as @2348082020006 pointed out to us that some of the questions are AI-generated.  I indeed confirmed this by creating another account and not sending the link.
[00:00, 25/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Also  Those that indicated interest or said they're open to trying it out should join Also  Those that indicated interest or said their open to trying it out should join this group chat.  https://chat.whatsapp.com/CgxI2JM2r9gAra41R7xMjc

[00:00, 27/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): My people
[00:00, 27/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): what's up
[00:00, 27/01/2024] exotic olive oil taster: <Media omitted>
[00:00, 27/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): A new addition to my Layi Wasabi sticker collection
[00:00, 27/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://kubool.com/kopal  Post any questions you have about data science  machine learning  AI. Or anything at all.  Will start answering by 12 midnight sharp
[00:00, 27/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Also  our study jam on machine learning will be online tomorrow 9pm.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Treyo: who’s good at ml here??
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yo guys what's up.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): My apologies for not keeping to this. An emergency came up yesterday that I needed to urgently attend to.  I hope this gave us opportunity to ask even more questions
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): A couple of us
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Treyo: can you tag anyone that has done any project
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I  @2348084276257   @2347026155404 and others  @2348136518781  is our oga
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): he's graduated though
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Treyo: mad o
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): As someone who isn't studying a computer course  my advice on how you start depends on the kind of course you're studying.  If you're doing something scientific (Maths  Basic sciences  engineering  medicine  economics  stats  etc)  I'll say go straight into learning how to code in either Python or R. Why I say this is you probably have the basic mathematics and statistical background necessary for data science and analytics.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you're doing a humanities course (Mass Communication  Law  Languages  political science  etc)  First  take some time to get familiar with the basic maths and statistics required.  Learn about the basics of probability  data sampling  and distributions. Learn about logic and boolean algebra.  Understand concepts like sampling and distributions (mean  median  mode  standard deviation  variance)  and probability (experimental and theoretical probability  Bayes theorem).  For core maths understand things like sets  mapping and functions  matrices  logical reasoning  and normal algebra.  You can learn this from any high school maths textbook
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you're feeling bougie  you can take a stab at more complex concepts like calculus and linear algebra.  But you can take those later if you're trying to find your feet.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I'll recommend this website to you to learning computer science and maths fundamentals   https://brilliant.org/
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It takes a fun and gamified approach. It helped me a lot when I was in high school
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You can take the foundational maths course
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We have things cooking for you. The second we feel you guys have grasped the fundamentals  we kick off
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): As for the second question  well  google ironically is arguably the one leading the artificial intelligence space
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Where google doesn't seem to be excelling at that much is in the LLM as a product space (large language model)
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): underline the word (As a product). Google's LLM as a service/product is nowhere close to GPT-4 in terms of its robustness and performance.  Although  the new bard seems to be better at computer vision tasks than GPT
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Asides from that  google has been a leader in that space  long before other giants like Microsoft  Apple  and OpenAI
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The first product I'd like to point out is Google's virtual assistant (Google Assistant). Currently  that is the most advanced virtual assistant compared to Siri and Bixby.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Although people argue that Google assistant is only that awesome when running on a google pixel
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But then  Siri only runs on iOS  Bixby only runs on Samsung
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Speaking of the devil  the Google Pixel also has some amazing image editing features that can only be possible through AI.   You can literally move objects in the image around or remove them completely and no one will notice.  You can check out more on the editor here  https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-magic-editor-pixel-io-2023/
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Then there's Google's subsidiary (Google DeepMind) and their discoveries.  Deep mind focuses more on reinforcement learning and robotics though.  So far  their most popular invention is the Alpha Go AI that's currently the world champion in the Go board game
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Then there's Google Lamda. An LLM Google refused to make open as a product. It's an internal tool that existed before GPT-3.5 used by Google engineers.  Apparently  it was so advanced  an employee accused it of being sentient (having emotions).  https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Yeah  but Google has a bad habit of releasing trailers of models they'll never release to the public
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Let's also not forget that the research on the main technology that powers most of these LLMs (Transformer networks)  was co-conducted by 8 google researchers.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So technically  the breakthrough we're seeing in LLMs today are as a result of Google's research
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): True  I think this one has something to do with them not seeing how they could make direct profit from the models
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Well  you can't compare googles text to image mode imagen to DALL-E 3. DALL-E 3 is on a different level. I'm saying this cause you can only access imagen true vertex ai and that's a lot of money OpenAI releases some of the best text to image models for free .
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: I agree Google has been dominating  but that's the past. How long has Google Assistant and Google Translate existed
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well  it still kind of boils down to them not seeing how they could make profit.  We can't really compare Google to OpenAI in terms of the decisions they can  make
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I don't think that's the past though.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Because  Generative AI is just one part of Artificial Intelligence in general.  In terms of Artificial Intelligence as a whole  I don't think anyone comes close to google
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): or rather  I don't think anyone has as many AI products as Google.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): or AI driven
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): There's Machine Learning in things we don't even expect machine learning to be in
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Like the google search engine  YouTube  even the Android OS has some services that are ML based.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Okay  I agree when it comes to generative ai Google needs to reevaluate their cooking recipe
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yes  I think google has some figuring out to do
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Although  its a huge question whether they want to go down that road.  I was listen to someone the other day  his take on the whole thing is that Google just doesn't see the value in investing in LLMs as a product.   But then I'm conflicted on the issue. If that was the case  they would have never released Bard
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But then again  Google has the funding  the data   and the talent to crush OpenAI's GPT-4
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Google's research also has other priorities asides from AI too. Another point to consider.  Google is heavily invested in Quantum Computing research
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: I'm not going to lie Google AI feature like search this song which uses audio fingerprinting is nice but openai launched point e  DALL-E 3  Shap·E you can check them out intact I just saw Luma ai on web and discord text to 3d and its seamless I still believe DALL-E 3 is the best text to image model there is because of his coherence
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: In response to this  Google releases videos and research papers for products they'll never release as I said before to use imagen it's only through vertex ai and it's expensive
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Microsoft offers DALL-E 3 for free through Copilot  Bing AI  and designer
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I see. I haven't really checked out DALL-E so I can't give an opinion on this. But I'll look into it
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Yeah  most people even hardly use Google Assistant
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I can kind of understand Microsoft's decision here.  Microsoft is trying to gain traction on Bing
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Yeah  and it's working. Have you seen Edge? It can summarize videos you watch on YouTube now
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 👀🔥
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): As a Google fanboy  I haven't really check out Edge lately. But I'll try my hands on it
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: Actually google has made some very mad moves very recently and is now somewhat a competitor with gpt-4. Not as good as the gpt-4 turbo though.  https://chat.lmsys.org
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Chatbot Arena. 👀
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: A thing to note that not all improvements to these closed models are announced. Gpt-4 has gotten significantly better on African languages in the past months and a lot of people in the African research communities are just realizing it.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Oh  I'm guessing through Gemini Pro and Ultra
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: OpenAI > Google DeepMind though.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: I don’t think ultra has been released yet. That’s the crazy part 😭
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I'm conflicted on this 😂
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Personally  I'd prefer working at Deep Mind.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: I'm sorry but I don't think that's right I've used Bard before on a flower on the right it told me the left but when I use Bing AI(Now Microsoft Copilot) it told me right the correct answer.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Michael.: I got one question  why do we (mostly African devs) talk about AI more than we actually build them  we have communities  groups  teams that talk about AI and are enthusiastic about it  but not major results  i might see things wrongly  correct me if i am .
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I feel OpenAI is too focused on Generative Models  Although it's very fruitful. Generative AI may be the key to unlocking AGI as it's the most promising route
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: Yeah I agree with this.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well  I'm talking about Bard powered by Gemini. It has crazy features.  I watched a video of a youtuber drawing on paper  Bard was able to predict what he was drawing before he even finished in real time
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: Well this is true in most groups. But there are groups that people are actually doing stuffs.  One other reason I would say people aren’t building stuff like they should is probably because we don’t have much access to the shiny equipments that power research
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Yeah  but Google mentioned the Bard they made available to the public is power by Gemini Pro
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Exactly most of the time  we need to run it on their servers when training models
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: You mean the announcement video. That video was edited oh. It wasn’t as real-time and they also added some prompting to that thing .
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Thank you. That video was different from what I experienced
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Not the announcement video  it was a youtuber who was testing.  @2348148935061 knows what I'm talking about
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: One thing that makes me confident with this is that. As big as google is you can see that they are always benchmarking against OpenAI. Which is weird because if you are ahead of someone why are moving like you are trying to catch up.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: Oh if you can get the video please send
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Currently searching for it
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Thiss
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It all boils down to technological infrastructure.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Ok I believe this is the video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIZAiXYceBI  Looks like it was from Google
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Though it's not the announcement video
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Although now that you said this  I'm a bit conflicted on whether this one is edited too 😂  Well  even if it's not exactly real-time  it's still impressive
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: That’s the announcement video.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Check this one out and read the comments Google Text to Video model Lumiere AI https://youtu.be/f9ThAzZs32M?si=b_uxtCcLyueMbNy_
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: I was actually heartbroken too. Cause I was rooting for google
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I see
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: The models looks very good  but even from the comments people are not even expecting it to be released anytime soon
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: This is very very recent. Nice
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: They're not even sure if it will ever be released
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): This looks impressive.  The comments though 😭
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I don't want it to look like I'm making excuses for google  but google is a much larger company.   It's possible that some management decisions may prevent them from releasing some of the products they work on (including AI products)
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: True. OpenAI moves like a startup.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): exactly. there are fewer approvals and bureaucracy involved
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: I'm guessing they are playing it safe
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh.  For a company the size of Google  profits are way more important than anything else.  Definitely more important than democratizing AI
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: @2348156713736 brilliant is paid right?
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh. They operate a freemium model though.  Some of the stuffs are free
[00:00, 28/01/2024] M.I: mark rober mentioned it wasn’t particularly real time he said he still had to prompt multiple times to get the correct output.  But his own was less edited
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Yeah  I agree  but that also leads them to discontinue a lot of products. We know of Google graveyard and also translatotron a model meant to translate someone's voice to another language while still keeping their voice the research paper was released 2017 so when Google releases a model or a breakthrough in AI people just look away I also believe the reason we got Bard was to compete with GPT-4
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Guy: Oh ok. You might find this interesting too.  https://afaik.io
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): checking it out now
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Very true.  Google has a track record of shutting down products or not even releasing them in the first place.  Maybe that's why their researchers focus more on journals and research papers.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But that means only people who follow up on research papers and journals would know about google's breakthroughs.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Exactly
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Hopefully Google gets to release the good stuff to the public
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): their polar opposite is Meta
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Meta seems to be the Fortune 500 that's most invested in open source.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Yes but their models still seems to be in the early stages
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): yhh
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: I also don't know why they took away their generative ai stickers
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: But Imagine by Meta AI still needs some work
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Tobi: Llama 2 is fast and pretty descent too and I hear they are training Llama 3 .
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Time is all Meta needs.  They have the money  a promising team  a good leader in their AI space (Yan LeCunn) and a technical CEO (Not a business guy)
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): This is really nice
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Alright let's move on to the next question
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Classification and Regression are under supervised
[00:00, 28/01/2024] harunafaruk: Hello  I'm Haruna Faruk and I am new Here.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Hi Haruna 👋  Welcome to the club
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Pick Analytics if:  1. You are more interested in getting insights from data 2. You don't want to write so much code (You can use tools like Power BI  and Tableau). If at all you're going to write code  it'll probably be in SQL 3. You enjoy story telling (You engage in activities like writing) 4. You like visualisaitons
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Pick ML/AI if:  1. You enjoy writing code. 2. You have a strong mathematics or computer science background. 3. You're coming from a different field in the tech space (from mobile  web  backend  etc). 4. You want to build products
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I guess that's all the questions for now.  If you've got any more questions  fell free to click the link  https://gdpd.xyz/kopal
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Imokut: I'm good
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): And please  let's not forget.  Today at 9pm.  Study jam on Linear Regression (and more).
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Online
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Ulenyo: Starting a career in Data Engineering Space has begun  https://twitter.com/tech_queen/status/1751665986908917800?t=rlXMDzpFCJ8p3vi_ZAOg8g&s=19
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Edidiong: i almost forgot😭
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What's up guys
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Emmerick: Yooo
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://meet.google.com/xjh-ebao-mcc  You can start joining
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Let's get our hands dirty
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://meet.google.com/mjg-ognx-tpt  Yo guys
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The other link got busted. Lets hop on this one to round up
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): within 30 mins
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): or 15
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Big shoutout to everyone who turned up.  Special shoutout to our Pioneer lead @2348136518781 for showing up.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The notebook will be refined and uploaded before next Saturday.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): In today's study jam  we looked at Linear Regression with just NumPy. we also touched other Machine Learning and Statistics essentials such as:  1. Measuring model's performance with Mean Squared error and Mean absolute error 2. Brief explanation of overfitting and train-test splitting.  In the next study jam  we will have another workshop / study jam on Classification with Decision Trees.  Like today  we will be trying our hands on using just numpy.  But we will also introduce ourselves to a machine learning framework called `scikit-learn`  scikit-learn provides a lot of models for you already implemented.  We will also look at underfitting and overfitting more indepth
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I would like all of us to try our hands on linear regression using this dataset
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): One is the one we looked at today. predicting a student's performance based on how many hours he studied
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The other is predicting your insurance premium based on your age.
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Try using numpy to come up with a linear model for these two datasets
[00:00, 28/01/2024] chibuzor: Can you send the one you did today like that
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): sure
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Will push it to Colab
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 28/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WBUY-6e48uSZqLBHO3LK_RzdI9wK30K5?usp=sharing  @2349014307553
[00:00, 28/01/2024] chibuzor: Thanks
[00:00, 29/01/2024] chibuzor: I have one question tho  it's on this Linear Regression method  can it be used in every aspect of prediction or generation
[00:00, 29/01/2024] chibuzor: And also Mean Absolute Error Function is missing
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Well  it pretty much works on problems that are linear
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That is  the trend of x and y is a straight line.
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Things like figure like predictions?
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Lemme send some images
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Eg Prices  Or Numbers in General that depends on some variables
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yup
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Though notall of them
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Can you give me like an example?
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you look at the bottom right graph  you will notice that its not a straight line
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): There are many systems like this
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: So it all depends on how well it correlates or something else?
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Think of the problem of how many employees do we need to maximize throughput
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It depends on whether you can notice a straight line trend
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Alright so for something like an arc  something else is used
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): One way to do this mathematically is something called Spearman ranking
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yup
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: It's a correlation method rii
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That r value you see there is the Spearman rank coefficient
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh  its a way of seeing if two variables correlate linearly
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: So if its closer to one we decide to go with a Linear Regression method
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If its close to 1 or -1
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Close to 1 is positively correlated  Close to -1 is negatively correlated.
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Close to 0 is no correlation
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Owh alright buh not close to 0 rii
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yup
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Alright thanks sha
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You can try experimenting with different datasets from kaggle.com
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you come across any roadblocks feel free to message here
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Yeah I just finished the Titanic Survival stuff and I use Linear Regression for that one
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Just tried it on a Population Prediction Dataset and I'm getting an r2_score of -0.5
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Ok thats calm 🔥   One thing you can look into is Logistics regression
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Sorry that's actually what I used
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If i remember correctly  the dataset is a classification problems.   Log regression is slapping something called an activation function on top your linear model
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Nice 🔥🔥
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: They are kinda like the same actually except one is This or that while the other is just extra figures
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh  one basically converts those figures to be between two numbers
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Usually 0 and
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 1
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Lookup something called sigmoid.
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Its a mathematical function that does just that
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Really coz all I did was remove the ones that wasn't really correlated to the survival then trained it with the rest  tweaked some things to be numbers sha stuff like the sex and embarked location
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Okay sure
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Thats calm.  We will also explore feature selection and feature engineer in one of our study jams.   To know how to handle things like non numerical features
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Yeah buh what if  hypothetically speaking we have like different values entirely can we do like an encoding done by the computer itself to matching values instead of just mapping it to figures
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Ok so there are two main ways to handle non numerical values
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You either one hot encode them or ordinally encode then
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): *them
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): One hot encoding is for features with no rank.   For example  you'd like to encode people's state of origin to fit in your model.  You one hot encode cus it doesn't make sense to say something like   Abia > Kano
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But for things like grade  that have a rank (i.e A>B>C>D)  we ordinally encode.   That is  replace each category with a number that represents its rank
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): @2349014307553
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Wait sorry you were saying something like other columns will be zero buh the state is already a column in the dataset
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The original state column will be dropped
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: So extra columns for each state will be created
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yup
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: What?! It's alright sha we'll get there 🥲
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You're thinking of the size yh? 😅
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Like bro
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: I can't imagine using df. info() or df.count() and I'm seeing length 45 or smth else .
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh  at that point you probably wouldn't have to
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: True true
[00:00, 30/01/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 30/01/2024] chibuzor: Yeah thanks
[00:00, 31/01/2024] Desmond: Is the exam free or do I hav E to pay ?
[00:00, 31/01/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): Without the voucher it's 39$ for nigerians  the voucher let's you write it for free
[00:00, 31/01/2024] Desmond: How do I get the voucher
[00:00, 31/01/2024] chibuzor: Funny how I once took this course but couldn't take the exam coz its premium 🥲
[00:00, 31/01/2024] Onofiok: The vouchers will be given to @2348101694302  and he'll be the one to send them out. The metric for getting a voucher is completion of a challenge on the microsoft learn platform though so he can tell you guys more about that.
[00:00, 31/01/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): Sorry guys  messed up the link for the study group  the other one was for a previous cohort 🙇🏾‍♂️

[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yo guys
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): what;s up
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So unexpectedly  today was packed for me. so we will be moving our Classification study jam.
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): In the meantime  I'd like all of us to consume the content on this link  https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/video-lecture
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It's a video on classification
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): The new date for the study jam will be communicated later this week.
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): In the study jam  we will look at.  1. Classification algorithm: Decision Trees 2. Decision tree hyperparameters. 3. Metrics for classification: Accuracy. 4. Metrics for classification: Precision and Recall
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Here's a great read on how the algorithm works.  https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/decision-tree-algorithm-explained.html
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So as a form of compensation for postponing the study jam. I'm going to give us a hint on what we're going to be doing for the next couple of weeks/study jams  After this coming study jam  we will have another on clustering with KMeans. That study jam will be the last study jam we will have on classical machine learning.  We will then jump into deep learning and Neural Networks
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Also  we will use Tensorflow for our study jams from now on instead of NumPy. (Don't worry  they have very similar APIs) .
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That being said  I'll advice we use Google Colab as opposed to TensorFlow as installing TensorFlow can be a hassle sometimes.
[00:00, 04/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you're reading this  react to this message with your favourite emoji.  If you've read this and you don't understand  feel free to shoot me a question

[00:00, 08/02/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): Do that then
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Desmond: How do I do it ?
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): Try adding a payment method on your app
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Desmond: view once media
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): Hmmm  try paying through the app then
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Guy: If anyone has gemini advanced and chatgpt plus  run comparisons let’s see.
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Mileke: <Media omitted>
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Mileke: Why person go get the two😹
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: Dem don help me run am for youtube
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: Gemini is faster on average 2 or 3x
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: Has better or stricter guard rails
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: But the answers are usually the same for most regular uses
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: But in theory due to a larger context window gpt-4 should be able to keep up better with longer prompts and have more context
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: Source: trust me nigga
[00:00, 08/02/2024] M.I: Lol - https://youtu.be/ucd63nIZZ60?si=i49PyetMZMTC5X-x
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Na the steeze be that

[00:00, 08/02/2024] Guy: Money bags now. I dey wait for ultra api.
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Guy: I watched this already. But I actually want to test something closer to our local context.
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What's up people
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): If you're up at this time  I salute ya
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): There's been a change of plans
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Our study jam on classification will be this Sunday
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Emmerick: No gree for sleep😤
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But this time  we will combine it with clustering.  This Sunday  we will look at both Decision Trees and KMeans clustering alongside some other industry practices and techniques.
[00:00, 08/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): thaseet
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yo guys
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): 👀
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Check out these videos in preparation for our study jam
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://youtu.be/ZVR2Way4nwQ?feature=shared
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://youtu.be/sgQAhG5Q7iY?feature=shared   Our decision trees implementation would be based on this
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): https://youtu.be/4b5d3muPQmA?feature=shared    Here's a video explaining K-Means clustering very well
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): yo guys
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): what's up
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So there are complications.  Turns out the week of prayer might be a problem.  An event that starts at 5:30pm and ends around 8:15pm may pose an issue as we may not b settled by 9pm to have our study jam
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 10pm would be too late.
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We may be busy at earlier points of the day.   So let's vote on a decision
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): POLL: How do we play our Classical ML Grand Finale workshop? OPTION: Have it by 10pm (0 votes) OPTION: Samuel shares the notebook for you to study and play with. If you have questions  you ask on the gc. (5 votes) OPTION: Samuel gives a quiz on classification and clustering (1 vote) OPTION: Samuel Opens a discussion on classification and clustering on the GC (0 votes) OPTION: Samuel shares the notebook and challenges us to apply it to a dataset from Kaggle. (2 votes) 
[00:00, 10/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Keep in mind that we're jumping into deep learning next sunday
[00:00, 12/02/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Helloooooo everyone  it’s that time of the month again🥳🤭

[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: Welcome to another gemini era😂
[00:00, 15/02/2024] chibuzor: Is it even up to 2 weeks since the last?
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: Google is beginning to move like a startup.
[00:00, 15/02/2024] chibuzor: They just want a bullish stock price 🤧
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: openai.com/sora  And Open AI strikes again!
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: Today is a blessed day.
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: In response to Google's Lumiere AI  a model they would never release  I like that .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: But this is insane. Things are looking scary🤩
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Michael.: open AI is on something those guys should be investigated 😂  I think ai is improving wayy too fast  I cant catch up😭 .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: I swr I'm seeing homemade video of Lagos Nigeria
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Michael.: guuyy these guys are moving too fast  it's oppressing small devs like me😭
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: It’s not a “small devs” problem. The speed at which AI is moving is quite crazy. Everyone even researchers find it hard to keep up.
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: I agree text to 3d that's I was thinking would be available 2030 is already here .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Michael.: exactly  guy you read my mind
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: You can check it out:  https://lumalabs.ai/genie .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: The 3d models it generates are pretty good. You can also download on blender  unity  unreal engines  and many more.
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Michael.: i want to understand something  do devs really require massive amount of computation power to build models like this?  is it possible for devs with highend gpu's build this
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: I think ideally you would need a cluster of high end GPUs to do this.
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: This model was just published today  February 15  MMXXIV
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: 👆That is Sora by OpenAI;  https://openai.com/sora .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: So it's very  very recent
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Tobi: I'm surprised by how quick you found the model .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] Guy: Turn on twitter notifications of notable researchers in these companies.  I sent the gemini about 30 mins after Jeff Dean announced it too. .
[00:00, 15/02/2024] chibuzor: I don't know if you guys saw that video of Will Smith eating spaghetti last year buh mehn they've gone a very long way in just 1 year
[00:00, 15/02/2024] chibuzor: And also thanks @2347057657787
[00:00, 15/02/2024] chibuzor: *AI generated video BTW
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yo yo yo
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What's up guys
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Trust you're kicking it
[00:00, 17/02/2024] exotic olive oil taster: 🤲
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I know I said on Valentines  but unfortunately I was preoccupied with activities (Not the activities you're thinking of).
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): But here's the Notebook as promised
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Please and Please. Take your time to go through this and come up with questions to ask me.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Spent all night working on this. I may or may not go for Sabbath this morning.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): That being said  I'm pleased to announce that we've finally made it to the part we've all been waiting for
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We're going to be looking into Deep Learning and Neural Networks
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What is Deep Learning and Neural Networks?  I consider it programming by optimization
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Instead of representing your apps with textual modules and routines  you represent your programs as Vectors.  A typical program is input  process and output. That process is usually represented with a python or Java or C++ function. That's how the regular guys do it
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We deep learning engineers use vectors and matrices to represent the process.  We get input (user's vector of numbers)  (our vector of numbers)  and output (Desired output  as vectors of numbers)  Because if you really think about it  the input  process  and output flow looks a lot like *linear transformations*  It is a mathematical way of thinking about software beneficial to Data Scientists and normal programmers.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What makes it an art is that  we program these process vectors by optimizing it iteratively.  The optimization step is heavily based on *Derivatives and calculus* (It's easier than it sounds  trust me).  This way  our process adjusts itself to become the vector that will give the correct linear transformations almost all the time.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We will be having our first study jam on the 25th (Upper Sunday) and it's going to be *physical*  In the meantime  we will be having discussions here to unravel some of the concepts
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: Can't find a data shuffling method? And how necessary is it??
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: A lot of questions 🤯
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: First  why picking just the Good apples in your dependent variable  y
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: And also the Decision Tree Class is my second question just that everything about it
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Oh yhh
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): It's very necessary.   Randomness improves the performance of a decision tree.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): There are some datasets that are sorted based on their labels.   It's good to shuffle them
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Picking just yhe good apples?  Oh you mean  The line df[target] == 'Good' yh?
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): So that's actually a boolean expression rather than a filter.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): We use that to cast it to true or false.  True is if its good  false is if its not.   Then we cast to an integer (0 or 1)
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 0 meaning false  meaning not good  meaning bad.   1 meaning true  meaning good
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): 😅😅   I'll post a simplified explanation
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You can also check out the YouTube video posted earlier.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): He explains it very well
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: Owh okay  buh why was the one hot encode not used?
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: And also why just Decision Trees and not Logistics Regression or SVM
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: Is it better  understandable or performs better?
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: And also all classification datasets I've seen so far has just been let's say Good or bad  0 or 1  can it be more than 2 let's say medium  small and large or something like that
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): OK so one hot encoding is only used when we have categorical values (text data)   We use it to represent them as numbers.  In the apples dataset all the features we're numerical
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Great question.  So you can actually try your hands on other classification algorithms.   We specifically looked at decision trees as an example of how classification works.  Decision tress was picked for this study jam because its an elegant algorithm. One that's useful to both data scientists and programmers
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Sure. You can pick out a dataset that's multinomial
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): And use the same decision trees algorithm on it
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: The Quality column wasn't .
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yh  the quality column was the target and not one of the features.
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: And also what is 'inf' you used it somewhere something like float(inf)
[00:00, 17/02/2024] chibuzor: @2348156713736 this your _find_best_split method gives me serious PTSD  I think it was from one of leetcodes questions
[00:00, 17/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yh  its used to represent infinity in python
[00:00, 18/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yhh  so basically  its the method that let's us know which of the conditions and coljmn best splits the dataset
[00:00, 18/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): You can lookup something called information gain
[00:00, 18/02/2024] chibuzor: Okay thanks
[00:00, 18/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): And impurity
[00:00, 18/02/2024] CakeCombat: Pls What time?
[00:00, 18/02/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): What time do you suggest

[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: Hi Guys I have a question  what could possibly cause a model I trained with a lower version of tensorflow to suddenly have a relatively lower accuracy when I updated my tensorflow installation?  And any ideas how to resolve?
[00:00, 20/03/2024] chibuzor: Did you reshuffle the data?
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: It’s seeded
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: So should be the same thing
[00:00, 20/03/2024] chibuzor: My power is limited from here on out
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: Thanks  I’ll try tweaking some of the parameters
[00:00, 20/03/2024] exotic olive oil taster: did the model's architecture change in any way
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: Nah
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: Basically updated tensorflow and re ran the notebook
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: Because for some reason I think the lower version uses more memory when loading the model causing my deployments to keep crashing
[00:00, 20/03/2024] exotic olive oil taster: how drastic is the drop in accuracy. objectively speaking
[00:00, 20/03/2024] chibuzor: Is it possible to look for someone with an older version and re-run it
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: 98. To about 87
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: And validation accuracy from 97ish to 69
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: I updated the dropout I was using from .5 to .3 seems to be working but it hasn’t finished training yet so lets see .
[00:00, 20/03/2024] exotic olive oil taster: alright 🥂
[00:00, 20/03/2024] M.I: It worked 97 acc and 92 Val acc I’ll take this 😅
[00:00, 22/03/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): My people

[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Whats up guys
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Here's a little ice breaker for everyone
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Assume the piece on the bottom right doesn't exisf
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Ok ykw  leave it there
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Its more fun that way 🌚🌚

[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Show workings 💪 too 🌚
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Things to note  it's only one dice and the dice is fair
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Another tip  figure out the conditions necessary for each team to win  and calculate the probability of that happening
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): blue needs just 1/6 on each turn but the probability of red winning on the first turn is zero  till the pieces get closer and then it'll become 1/6 for each turn as well because each dice roll is 1/6 so short term blue is more likely to win  then in the long term it equalises
[00:00, 27/05/2024] kejleb: <Media omitted>
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Emmanuel: This question is actually more complicated than it seems on the surface because it depends largely on how many turns are played
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Emmanuel: It takes red anywhere between 9 turns (only if 6s are rolled) to 50 turns (only if 1s are rolled) to simply get within range of winning and the probability of it taking any given number of turns isn't evenly distributed
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Emmanuel: It's only after red has gotten within range of winning that both players have equal chances of winning  provided green hasn't already won up until that point
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Emmanuel: It's easy to observe that green has a far greater chance of winning overall but calculating the actual probability is pretty complicated  so I went for the easier approach and ran a simulation
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Emmanuel: <Media omitted>
[00:00, 27/05/2024] Emmanuel: For those that can't run the script  the tl;dr is green has a ~96.08% probability of winning the game

[00:00, 02/06/2024] Guy: These are very solid papers. Another solid approach towards learning is to pick a paper that interests you and read/study recursively. You can also use chatgpt  blogs and youtube videos to augment your learning.  I feel ml research is moving too fast to be reading all these old papers in depth. Reading recursively will direct you to only important papers. .
[00:00, 02/06/2024] Riley (GDG Lead): i usually just copy and paste into chatgpt and tell it to explain it for me most of the time
[00:00, 02/06/2024] Tobi: Concerning this  I'm actually glad ml research is moving faster than we expected. For the research papers  though  most of the time  it's too complex as @2348101694302 said it's better to use a transformer to break it down.
[00:00, 02/06/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Thank you for the tip  wise one
[00:00, 02/06/2024] Guy: wise one bawo? We are learning from you ma.
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Yikes  I actually forgot about this 😅
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Hmm  interesting 
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): @2348101694302
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): I think It depends though  it doesn't hurt to know how most of these algorithms or concepts work under the hood from the researchers perspective to build a story path   Like you said  the industry is moving too fast so you should probably not take reading these papers as a prereq for getting career ready  but from a research perspective  its great to know the intent and thought process behind these papers
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Interesting
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Will solve this on paper and get it to you by EOD (in this contexr thats probably midnight)
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Here's another hint though   Look at this problem in two layers  1. What are the chances red moves forward  or green moves forward 2. If either of them moves forward  whats the chance that the dice brings them closer to victory
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Abolo (Former Data Lead): Then another hint  for red to win  both of the pieces need to make it to the bin
[00:00, 03/06/2024] Guy: If you take a research paper and read recursively you would get a clear view of the story path. For example  I am currently trying to replicate chameleon and suppose I haven’t read any paper before. I would have to read for the language part: llama 2  llama1  gpt 3  RMSNorm  layer norm  batch norm  gpt neo  swiglu  original transformers paper  RNNs  wavenet(convolutions in sequence modeling)  a neural probabilistic language model. For the image part  make a scene  vqgan  gan  vqvae  vae  autoencoders and lenet.  You find out that with this you get a clear view of how the whorl thing progressed. You will miss a few solid papers (for example in this  we missed the vit paper  clip paper) on your first read but if you take like 2 or 3 papers you would have covered almost all you need to cover in that field. .
[00:00, 03/06/2024] M.Blessed: Sensei spitting!

[00:00, 10/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): <Media omitted>
[00:00, 10/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): *UPDATE ON THE DATACAMP SCHOLARSHIP*  Hi my data family   I come with amazing news. The wait is finally over (for some of you)— Our request for more licenses has been granted!  Please keep an eye out for an invitation email to join our new DataCamp group anytime from Wednesday :)  And you know what to do  when you get access to all of DataCamp  please use it  use it  USE IT.  P.S. Thank you to all my amazing data campers that helped us reach a 95% adoption rate.
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Hi my data family!
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Can we all look at this scenario:  The university has built a model that classifies students as 'at risk' and 'not at risk' of failing based on their CA and historical data of previous sets. But their model is performing poorly because many of the students who were classified as 'not at risk' eventually failed... they've called you to improve their model before the next academic year.
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Which classification metric will you prioritize to improve the model?
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): If you've not learnt about classification metrics  you can read this and attempt my question:  https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): POLL: Which classification metric will you prioritize to improve the model? OPTION: Accuracy (0 votes) OPTION: Recall (6 votes) OPTION: Precision (0 votes) OPTION: FPR (2 votes) 
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): If you've voted on the poll  please don't be shy  feel free to shed more light on why you chose your option :)
[00:00, 11/11/2024] chibuzor: I picked recall because it's the only metric I know here that makes use of the false negatives
[00:00, 11/11/2024] Smile: Well...Recall because it focuses on the model's ability to correctly identify true positive cases....in other words accurately classifying students who are actually at the risk of failing... But this will result in a trade-off  with precision.
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Hey guys  sorry I disappeared on you all after starting a discussion😭😂
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): I can see most people picked recall  while some others picked FPR which stands for false positive rate.  So  I'll respond to the people who gave further context to their chosen answers and explain my own answer and why I feel other options aren't as correct as mine.
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Interesting take  your perspective in itself is fantastic but you should try to link it to the real world problem at hand  what does false negatives represent in that scenario? And how does recall 'make use of false negatives' to solve the problem? What does recall tell you about your model in general?  TL;DR  link your explanation to the problem
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Nice  it's good how you circled back to the scenario. Just that when you say 'correctly identify true positive cases'  it sounds like the explanation of precision.  Precision tries to make sure that all cases marked as positive by the model are truly positive  in other words correctly identifying true positives.  But recall on the other hand tries to identify all true positive cases  correctly  yes  but it doesn't really care if they're al correct  as long as all existing positive cases are identified  it's good to go.  And that's why it'll result in a trade off with precision because if 10 out of 100 are truly positive  and the model says 50 (including the 10) are positive  the recall will be 100% because the model was able to identify all cases. But precision will be way lower (20%) because majority of the cases flagged as positive by the model were actually not positive.  Generally  good perspective  I think the missing keyword is just 'all'.  TL;DR  Recall focuses on the model's ability to correctly identify ALL true positive cases that exist.
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Having said this  I guess we can all agree recall is the metric to optimize for because the school wants to identify ALL students who are at risk.  Their greatest pain point is 'not being able to detect the risk before failure happens'. So  even if they have to provide counsel or whatnot to more students  including students who aren't actually at risk (false positive)  it's better than missing some students who are at risk (false negative).  So as Chibuzor rightly pointed out  we need a metric that will make the model minimize false negatives.  And @2348057342230 mentioned  we still can't overlook the tradeoff between recall and precision because let's be real  if the school isn't trying to reduce the number of students they need to give special counsel to  they won't need a model  they might as well just assume every student is at risk and give them counsel or whatever but that's not the case. They want to identify a (few) select students that truly need this extra attention so that they wouldn't fail...  So... in the real world  we should aim for a model that actually understands the pattern between CA and final grade. But for this scenario  given the constraints and the school's painpoint of missing students who are actually at risk  recall is what should be prioritized.
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Thank you all for not snubbing my poll😂🫶
[00:00, 16/11/2024] Anjola (Data Lead): Now  over to today's matter :)  I bring TWO amazing news to my data family (you all) tonight.
